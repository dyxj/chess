# Chess

## To Do
- Test for exported apply move
- Determining check mate
- Is there a need to keep track of check?

- threefold draw rule
  - board position must be the same 3 times including player turn(active color) and special moves(castling, enpassant)
  - with this rule, need to rethink some setups
- 50 move per side without pawn moves or captures = draw
